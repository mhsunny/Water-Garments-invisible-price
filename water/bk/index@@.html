        <p class="sub-text">Two things happen when such huge quantity of water is pumped out. First,
            we create a hollow underground. As the hollow grows, it creates chances for the earth to 
            cave in. <br><br>
            And secondly, as more and more water is pumped out, the water table goes down. 
            We can find this actually happening in Dhaka where every year water level is dropping by 2.5 
            percent. This means we have to dig deeper and deeper to get the same water out.<br><br>
            The water table is not infinite. One day, it will go dry. We will not have any more
            water to pump out. A real disaster will take place.

        <h1 class="heading">More water, more pollution</h1>
        <p class="sub-text">As the inefficient plants draw more water to treat the same quantity of fabrics,
            they use more chemical to do the job. More chemicals mean more pollution. 
            If they could cut their water requirement by one fourth, which is very much possible with
            available technology, they could have substantially cut use of chemicals 
            and thereby pollution too. <br><br>
            Also more water needs more gas to heat for dyeing and finishing of fabrics.
            Gas is a scarce commodity. Bangladesh is already running short of gas. The inefficient 
            plants are just adding to the crisis.

        <p class="sub-text">A handful few factories are changing their operation to be more water efficient. 
            International Finance Corporation (IFC) has introduced a programme styled Partnership for Cleaner Textile (PaCT) to reduce water, energy and chemical use in textile industry. It has partnered with 200 textile factories to help them implement cleaner operation. 
            Fakir Apparels Limited of Narayanganj is one of them to adopt clean operation.
            It would use 24.96 crore litres of water to wash and dye 1,200 tons of fabrics a month. But after it has changed its technology, its water use has drastically reduced to 6.96 crore litres. The factory saved 70 percent of water.
            Mondol Fabrics of Gazipur has been able to save 27 percent of water by using new technologies. It needed 120 litres of water to process one kilogram of fabrics. Now it needs 80 liters only. It is working to cut down water use further by putting in more technologies.
